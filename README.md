# üß∞ Install

To install and run this program you will need to have:
- python3
- pip3
- python3-venv

The next step is the cloning of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bthecs/ticket-system.git
```
Once the repository has been created, the virtual environment must be created within it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Once the virtual environment has been created, it must be activated as follows:

```bash
source ven/bin/activate
```
once inside the environment, the last step is the installation of the requirements:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# üöÄ Usage
To start the server there are two possibilities to run the server.py and it will take the default values or in case you want to modify the host and the port you have to pass by arguments its values.

- -h:  This argument will be used to indicate the host we want to run the server on.
- -p: this argument will be used to indicate the port we want to run the server on.
- -d: this argument is optional and can be used to display the logs through the terminal.

Example of server execution with default values:

```bash
python3 server.py
```
Example of server execution with modified values:

```bash
python3 server.py -h 192.0.0.1 -p 8080 -d True
```
To start the client there are two possibilities to run the client.py and it will take the default values or in case you want to modify the host and the port you have to pass by arguments its values.

- -h: This argument will be used to indicate the host we want to run the client on
- -p: This argument will be used to indicate the port we want to run the client on

Example of client execution with default values:

```bash
python3 client.py
```

Example of server execution with modified values:

```bash
python3 client.py -h 192.0.0.1 -p 8080
```
## üë®‚Äçüîß Client actions
Once the connection to the server is established, the client will be able to perform different actions through the CLI, these are:

list -t "Hello"
```

### Exit

# üö® Protocol
The socket used to perform the interconnection is AF_INET is used to designate the type of addresses with which its socket can communicate (in this case, Internet Protocol v4 addresses) and SOCK_STREAM type of the socket, dependent on the previous parameter (not all domains support the same types). In this case, a socket of type STREAM: using the TCP protocol, provides certain security guarantees: packets arrive in order, discarding repeated and/or corrupted packets.
